# Python Decorator Tutorial

This project includes the tutorial tests from my article [P-264 - Decorator Tutorial](https://ronjeffries.com/articles/-y023/python/-9z260/264/).

Also included are the tests that I wrote while learning how to create the decorators that I use in the tutorial.

Feedback on the tutorial is welcome. Email or Mastodon is best, I tend not to see pull requests.

Enjoy!
